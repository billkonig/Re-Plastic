# Re-Plastic

Web application that displays to the user which plastic waste items are recyclable in which parts of the city of St. Louis.  This 
application uses a Google Maps API with location markers to display the exact locations of every recycling dropoff in the city that accepts plastic waste, or the display can be refined with menu functions to only populate the map with dropoff location markers based on ZIP code or type of plastic accepted.  Regular Google Map operations such as zoom in/out, scroll/move map, and map/satellite view are functional as well.  By clicking on any of the location markers the user will see the name, address, and hours of operation of that particular dropoff at the top of the map.  The user can also access a complete list of every dropoff in the city that accepts plastic along with their name, address, and plastics accepted.  A list of all types of plastic waste that can be recycled from one's home recycling bin in the city is also accessible.  The user can also register with the website and log in and log out using email and password verification.  Runs from "npm start" command and SpringBackEndApplication.java.
