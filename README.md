# Re-Plastic

Web application that displays to the user which plastic waste items are recyclable in which parts of the city of St. Louis, MO.  This 
application uses a Google Maps API with location markers to display the exact locations of every recycling dropoff station in the city that accepts plastic waste, or can be refined with a search function to only populate the map with location markers based on ZIP code or type of plastic accepted.  Regular Google Map operations such as zoom in/out, scroll/move map, and map/satellite view are functional as well.  By clicking on any of the location markers the user will see the name, address, and hours of operation of that particular dropoff station at the top of the map, or can see a complete list of every dropoff station in the city along with their name, address, and plastics accepted by using the sidebar menu.  A list of all types of plastic waste that can be recycled from one's home recycling bin in the city is also accessible.
